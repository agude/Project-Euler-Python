"""
A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the
unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

    1/2  =   0.5
    1/3  =   0.(3)
    1/4  =   0.25
    1/5  =   0.2
    1/6  =   0.1(6)
    1/7  =   0.(142857)
    1/8  =   0.125
    1/9  =   0.(1)
    1/10 =   0.1

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be
seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of d  1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in
its decimal fraction part.
