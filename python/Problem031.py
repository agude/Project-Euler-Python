"""
In England the currency is made up of pound, $, and pence, p, and there are
eight coins in general circulation:

    1p,  2p,  5p,  10p,  20p,  50p,  $1 (100p) and $2 (200p).

It is possible to make $2 in the following way:

    1 * $1 + 1 * 50p + 2 * 20p + 1 * 5p + 1 * 2p + 3 * 1p

How many different ways can $2 be made using any number of coins?
